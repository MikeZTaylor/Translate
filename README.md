# Transtaal

The student has built an iOS translation app written in Swift, using MyMemory Translate API (https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php).
The app was created as part of a practical assignment at the Waterford Institute of Technology (http://www.wit.ie).

The app is optimised for the iphone 6+ and 7+ and contains some of the following features:
  - ability to translate English into Afrikaans, Hebrew, Irish, Icelandic and French
  - keyboard dismissal when not typing into text boxes
  - a two column picker for easier selection
  - a done button to dismiss keyboard if needed
  - lots of behind the scenes computing stuff

To really know the app, you'll have to:
  - look at the code
  - download the project and play around with it :)
